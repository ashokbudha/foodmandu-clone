# 🍽️ Foodmandu Project

This project uses real-time data from [Foodmandu](https://foodmandu.com/), which may be restricted by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies.

To allow your browser to fetch data from Foodmandu APIs during development, you need to **enable CORS**.

## 🚀 How to Enable CORS

Install the following Chrome extension to allow cross-origin requests:

🔗 [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en&pli=1)

> ⚠️ Use this extension **only for development purposes** and disable it when not needed for security reasons.

## 📌 Note

- Make sure the extension is toggled ON when testing API calls.
- This project is not affiliated with Foodmandu. The data is used for learning/demo purposes only.
